By Zardoua Yassir, PhD in Computer Vision

This code is inspired by the research presented in the paper titled:

*Horizon line detection in marine images: which method to choose?*

**Note:** This code implements the best algorithm presented in the paper, denoted as MED.

Feel free to modify and adapt this codebase to explore different horizon line detection methods for your specific needs.
